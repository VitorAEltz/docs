Attacks exceeding the volumes purchased may be immediately blocked until the attack ends. To be eligible for a Service Credit (a) the DDoS attack must result in a bill that exceed the double of the average monthly consumption in the previous six (6) months, excluding the months in which a DDoS attack took place; (b) in the event of an impossibility to calculate the average monthly consumption in the previous six months, the average consumption volume in the available months will be used as basis; (c) Customer must notify the Azion Technical Support about an attack underway by registering a Support Ticket; (d) the Azion Technical Support must have determined the reported DDoS attack is a legitimate attack; and (e) credit applications must be sent by Customer within 30 days after the disputed service bill is closed. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Managed DDoS Protection will be billed at (a) a monthly set fee according to the protection limit purchased (Protection Fee) and, additionally, (b) a fee per total GB traffic (Total Data Transferred). By purchasing our Managed DDoS Protection service, the Customer will be required to pay for a minimum of twelve (12) months of the service. In the event Customer’s average bill exceeds the volume purchased, or in case more than two credits are applied for in a given calendar year, Azion will be entitled to require Customer to pay an additional DDoS Protection Fee for each attack suffered. Only a single credit may be applied each month, even when several attacks take place in the same month. Credits are to be issued as a credit note instead of a revised bill.
